# The Expand of Infinite

21000 years in future  
Is not about us  
Is about Universe now 

We, **humans** play a key role in how the future will be.  
With the advancement in technology, things are becoming smaller in size yet more powerful.  
One day, we might be using our own **rocket** for transportation.

If the **infinite** is infinite, has it always been infinite.
and if the **infinite** can be be expanded we can be expanded.
Our **ideas** or view of the world.
